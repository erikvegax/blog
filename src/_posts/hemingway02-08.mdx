> "Look, baby, this is your old tooth brushing glass. I kept it all the time to remind me of you... I kept this to remind me of you trying to brush away the Villa Rosa from your teeth in the morning, swearing and eating asprin and cursing harlots. Every time I see that glass I think of you trying to clean your consience with a toothbrush."

> "Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the number of roads, the names of rivers, the number of regiments and the dates."

> "If you ever live to be as old as I am you will find many things strange."<br/>
> "You never seem old."<br/>
> "It is the body that is old... And the spirit is no older and not much wiser."<br/>
> "You are wise."<br/>
> "No, that is the great fallacy; the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful."

> "Nothing ever happens to the brave."<br/>
> "They die of course."<br/>
> "But only once."<br/>
> "Who said that?"<br/>
> "The coward dies a thousand deaths, the brave but one?"<br/>
> "Who said it?"<br/>
> "I don't know."<br/>
> "He knew a great deal about cowards but nothing of the brave. The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths... He simply doesn't mention them."
